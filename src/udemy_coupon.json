These \"units\" can be customers, orders, products, or any other relevant metric. Analyzing unit economics helps companies and experts assess the sustainability and profitability of their operations.</p><p>Here's why learning about unit economics is crucial for both experts and companies:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Sustainability and Profitability Assessment</strong>: Unit economics provide a clear view of whether a business is sustainable and profitable. By examining the revenue generated and the costs incurred on a per-unit basis, experts and companies can evaluate if they are making money or losing it with each sale or customer acquisition.</p></li><li><p><strong>Scaling Decisions</strong>: Understanding unit economics is vital for making informed decisions about scaling a business. If the cost to acquire a customer is higher than the revenue generated from that customer over time, it may not be sustainable to scale the business without making changes.</p></li><li><p><strong>Business Model Optimization</strong>: Unit economics analysis allows experts and companies to identify areas for optimization. It helps in finding cost-effective ways to acquire and retain customers, reduce operational costs, and increase average revenue per unit.</p></li><li><p><strong>Investor Confidence</strong>: For startups and growing companies, demonstrating positive unit economics is often essential to attract investors. It shows that the business model is sound and has the potential for long-term profitability.</p></li><li><p><strong>Risk Management</strong>: By understanding unit economics, companies can identify potential risks early. If the per-unit cost is too high, it may lead to financial instability or bankruptcy in the long run.</p></li><li><p><strong>Pricing Strategies</strong>: Unit economics are key in setting appropriate pricing for products or services. Companies can determine the right balance between pricing and costs to maximize profitability.</p></li><li><p><strong>Strategic Decision-Making</strong>: Business decisions related to product development, marketing campaigns, and resource allocation should be guided by a deep understanding of unit economics. It helps in focusing resources on high-impact areas.</p></li></ol><p>Developing skills related to unit economics can be highly beneficial for building a career in various fields, including business, finance, and entrepreneurship:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Entrepreneurship</strong>: Entrepreneurs who understand unit economics can create and refine business models that are more likely to succeed. This knowledge is crucial for securing funding and effectively managing their startups.</p></li><li><p><strong>Finance and Investment</strong>: Professionals in finance and investment need to evaluate the financial health of companies. An understanding of unit economics helps them assess the viability of potential investments.</p></li><li><p><strong>Marketing and Sales</strong>: Marketers can make informed decisions about customer acquisition channels and campaigns based on the cost to acquire a customer and the customer's lifetime value. Sales teams can prioritize high-value leads.</p></li><li><p><strong>Operations and Supply Chain Management</strong>: Professionals in operations and supply chain management can optimize processes, reduce costs, and improve efficiency by analyzing the unit economics of production and distribution.</p></li><li><p><strong>Consulting and Advisory Roles</strong>: Consultants and advisors who can help companies optimize their unit economics are highly sought after.

And there are the 16 years of rich history that's extremely important to understand where we are today with the 2018 version and some of the changes.<br><br>Furthermore, we're going to talk about a lot of different changes in the IEEE-1584 2018 standard. There are different busbar electrode combinations, there's a different voltage range and conductor gap information, there's information about the box, the height, the width, and the depth, and how they use that enclosure box to calculate the instant energy levels. There's the arcing current variation corrective factor that goes into a lot of detail, there is arc flash test, the continuous voltage spectrum, the enclosure size and correction factor, the table of equipment and class types, the minimum arcing current adjustments, and the 125 kVA transformer cutoff whatever happened to that, so we'll talk about that as well. Grounded versus ungrounded systems, the two-second rule cut off where that is, and as well as what's next? what goes above and beyond this 2018 standard?<br><br>So, stick around you'll expect to learn a lot from this standard and from this course.

This course aims to teach you the fundamentals of power transformer, making these connections understandable for you.</p><p><br></p><p>I will start this course by explaining the basics of Delta Wye connected transformer, how line to ground voltage can be related to line to line voltage and the practical examples to connect theory with practical life. This module will help you to understand the complex theory behind the Delta Wye transformer connection as I aim to build your strong concept through phasor diagrams. After this module you will be able to draw Delta Wye connection of transformer. By the end of this part, you will have a strong idea on voltage phasor diagram for delta connected transformer. In this module, different types of phasor diagram are compared with each other. I add on value by explaining how the transformer name is designated and the problems that come up with this designation.</p><p><br></p><p>Once you are familiar with the calculation and phasor representation of voltage and current quantities for Delta Wye connected transformer, I will introduce you to Wye Wye transformer connection. In this module, you will learn all the confusing theory of Wye Wye transformer connection from very scratch. This section will teach you how Wye connection is made on windings of transformer, what are different ways to configure Wye connection. To give you a better understanding of Wye Wye transformer connection, I discussed the difference of line and phase current in both windings of transformer. Furthermore, you will learn how voltage and current quantities are calculated in addition with the rules for balanced system, and how balanced sets are created by phasors.</p><p><br></p><p>Lastly, I will explain Circulating Currents and Voltages for Delta Wye connected transformer. Very simple power system is modelled as an example to calculate current and voltages during a faulted condition. For the practical model, you will learn how to calculate both phase and sequence current and voltages, how to relate sequence network diagram with hand-calculated short circuit currents. Furthermore, you will learn how current flows through the Delta Wye transformer connection. And how the High Voltage side of the system differs from the Low Voltage side.</p><p><br></p><p>I have been creating high quality video tutorials about Power Systems since 2015 and focus specifically on the fundamentals.
